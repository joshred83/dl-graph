ejl - please see somewhat YOLO'd update of dominant in `dominant.py`

calling convention is basically the same with new options/params.

usage:
- update the config dict in `main.py`
- run `main.py` which implements training and testing loops.
- loss plots, train/test metrics, and model params are saved in the `saved_models` directory
